# Foreword

**These tips imply the run is scouted.**

# Shield down, one-shot

The **quickest way** to destroy the **Overship** is to align the cannon so that it fires into one of its **round openings**, such as those circled in the image below. Any one works.

Only **one shot** is needed. However, you will need to **destroy** its **shield** first. The ![Expendable Napalm](/static/blob/7e93m83e.jpg) **Expendable Napalm** can take it down in a **single shot**. For a **multiplayer**, you can use the  ![Patriot Exosuit](/static/blob/ynl9d60n.jpg) **Patriot Exosuit** (it takes about 300 rounds from its minigun).

# Horizontal alignment

Once the cannon is **properly aligned** during your scouting run, proceed as if you were going to rotate the **horizontal valve** and turn your camera until your **compass** and the **upper part** of the cannon are **parallel**.

Keep the **degree number** (here **318**) in mind and during your attempts, **rotate** your **camera** while **pivoting** the cannon until the **compass box** showing that number is **aligned parallel** with the **cannon**.

# Vertical alignment

The **vertical alignment** primarily allows you to determine whether your **horizontal alignment** is **correct**.

Here, I have **three hints**:

- The **degree number** on the **compass** (here **1**).
- The **small box** around the **compass degree** (its **lower left corner** must touch the part of the cannon highlighted by a **red line**).
- The **trapezoid shape** highlighted by **red lines** through which the cannon **visually appears**.

It is much easier to control the **height** of the cannon in this **trapezoidal shape**. In my run, I knew it had to be roughly in the **middle**, with a little more "air" in the upper part of the trapezoid.
