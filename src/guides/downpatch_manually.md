**WARNING**: if you are downpatching to a version prior to **Omens of Tyranny**, ensure that you are **not** on an **Illuminate planet** before changing versions, otherwise your game will crash. It **won't crash** if you launch the game with the [DarkFluid Launcher](https://github.com/WernherVonKerman/DarkfluidLauncher/releases).

# 2. How to find the downloads you need

You need **three separate downloads** from **three separate depots**. You can find the links to each below:

- [Depot 553851](https://steamdb.info/depot/553851/history/)
- [Depot 553853](https://steamdb.info/depot/553853/history/) (large download size)
- [Depot 553854](https://steamdb.info/depot/553854/history/)

Find the **patch** you need by **browsing** [this list](https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Game_Version) and **match up** the **date** with the different **manifest IDs** on [this website](https://steamdb.info/app/553850/patchnotes/). If you can't find a manifest released on the **same date**, pick the **previous one**.

Then enter the **manifest ID** you want along with the corresponding **depot ID**.

# 3. Notes about items currently inaccessible on downpatch

Items from **Truth Enforcers**, **Urban Legends**, and **Servants of Freedom** are broken from **1.002.000** until **1.002.200**.

All warbonds except **Steeled Veterans** and **Helldivers Mobilize** have most items missing from them on patches before **1.001.000** (Escalation of Freedom). **All boosters** are also **missing** on these patches **except** for **Vitality**, **Stamina**, **Muscle Enhancement**, and **UAV Recon** booster.

All **ship modules** are **broken** on patches before **1.001.000**. To **re-enable** ship modules after returning to a newer patch, simply **re-open** the upgrades menu on a newer version.
