# 1. Glitches & exploits

## 1.1. Draw! Ultimatum

**Patch**: any since 01.002.201 (released March 25th 2025)

**Effect**: makes the **self-kill** with **Ultimatum** almost as fast as with **Crossbow** / **Eruptor**.

**Nota Bene**: this trick is mostly used in **Any% runs** for it allows you to destroy **nearby spawners** (fabricators, warp ships, holes) and to **consistently die** when you repod into **textures** that tend to make the Crossbow’s / Eruptor’s ammunition **bounce** (buildings, holes, rocks, slopes, etc.).

**How to**:

- Purchase the **Draw!** emote in the **Superstore** (250 Super Credits)
- Equip the **Draw!** emote aboard a **Super Destroyer**.
- While you’re **repoding**, press your **emote key**.
- **Hold down** the **fire button** as your Helldiver exits their **hellpod**.

## 1.3. Stratagem Duping

**Patch**: 1.003.000

**Effect**: duplicates **any stratagem** as you throw them. For instance: **3 Orbital Lasers** gathered in a **single beam** or **10 Walking Orbital Barrages** fired in the same area. Expect **lags** and **audio glitches**.

**Nota Bene**: it is mostly ineffective with **breakable stratagems** (Sentries, Tesla Tower, Emplacements, Shield Generator Relay, etc.) since they will most likely keep **crushing** each other as they spawn.

**Warning**: duping some **red stratagems** may **crash** your game. Stratagems with heavy **particle effects** and **shrapnel** are the most **unstable ones** (Orbital Airburst Strike, Eagle Cluster Bomb).

For **red stratagems**, we recommend staying at least **70 metres away** to avoid crashing your game.

Duping too many **stable** stratagems at the same time in a **multiplayer** run might **crash** your game too.

**How to**:

- Type your stratagem code normally.
- As you have the **stratagem ball** in your hand, open your **stratagems panel** again.
- Hold the **stratagem panel open** and throw the ball (your Helldiver should look at their **wrist**).
- You can **release** your key to close your **stratagem panel** right after throwing it.

## 1.4. Stratagem Duplication *via* Weapon Customization

**Patch**: 1.003.000

**Effect**: duplicates the **same stratagem** while choosing them before dropping in.

**Nota Bene**: while the **Stratagem Duping glitch** duplicates a given stratagem after you’ve thrown it, the **Weapon Customization glitch** allows you to **duplicate stratagems** in a way they’re considered **independent** from each other. For instance, duplicating the **Orbital Laser** 4 times and throwing one **won’t trigger** the **cooldown** for the other 3.

**How to**:

- Select the stratagem you want to **duplicate**.
- Close the **stratagem selection grid**.
- Switch to the **equipment selection** tab.
- Select your **primary weapon** and change the **customization preset**.
- Go back to the **stratagem selection grid**: you can pick again the **stratagem**.

You will have to repeat this **menuing** for each duplication you want to perform. The following **key sequence** might help you to speed it up:

- **Space bar** (open the stratagem selection grid).
- **Left click** on the stratagem.
- **Right click** (exit the grid).
- **R** (switch to equipment tab).
- **Left click** on your primary weapon.
- **R** (change customization preset).
- **Right click** (exit the weapon customization tab).
- **R** (switch to stratagem selection tab).
- **Space bar** (open the stratagem selection grid).

**Nota Bene bis**: even after **restarting your game**, you might not be able to select the **stratagem** you’ve **duplicated**. To fix it:

- Select **stratagems** you **don’t want to use**.
- Exit your **hellpod**.
- Enter your **hellpod** again.

**How to**:

- As soon as you drop, call in the **Personal Shield Generator**.
- Equip it and leave the mission area until you’re at least 350m away from the **main objective site**.

**Nota Bene**: aiming in **first person** might make you vulnerable to the **traitor barrage**. If **Deathless** is not a requirement, **killing yourself** will reinforce you at **main objective site**.
