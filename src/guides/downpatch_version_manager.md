This guide covers how to use the [TimeDivers manager](https://github.com/leem919/timedivers-manager/) created by **leem919** to **downpatch** Helldivers 2. This method is generally more suitable for non-technical users and users new to downpatching.

- [Downpatch your game (manually)](https://www.speedrun.com/Helldivers2/guides/zf9n8)

**WARNING**: if you are downpatching to a version prior to **Omens of Tyranny**, ensure that you are **not** on an **Illuminate planet** before changing versions, otherwise your game will crash. It **won't crash** if you launch the game with the [DarkFluid Launcher](https://github.com/WernherVonKerman/DarkfluidLauncher/releases).
