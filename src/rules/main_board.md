## GUIDES

- [Min Difficulty and Max Difficulty table for missions](https://www.speedrun.com/Helldivers2/guides/y5pu3).
- How to downpatch your game [manually](https://www.speedrun.com/Helldivers2/guides/zf9n8) or [with a version manager](https://www.speedrun.com/Helldivers2/guides/e9976).
- [How to play Meridia and Gloom missions](https://www.speedrun.com/Helldivers2/guides/ep9oo).

If you wish to submit **Deathless runs**, check the [Helldivers 2 Category Extensions page](https://www.speedrun.com/HELLDIVERS_2_Category_Extensions).

The **general rules** cover the following points:

1. **Ban**/**violations** (in-game, community guidelines).
2. **Submission guidelines** (scope, explanatory tables).
3. **Standards of proof** (recording requirements, HUD visibility, Un-Scouted proof).

Before submitting, make sure you read the **category-specific rules**:

Runs that are **impossible** to **tie** or **beat** (usually due to **mechanics** that are **temporary** and/or inaccessible *via* **downpatch**) are moved to the **No Longer Possible** subcategory.
__________

## 1. BAN/VIOLATIONS

### 1.1. IN-GAME

On the usage of **glitches**, **skips**, **exploits** and **patched game mechanics**, see **Category rules**. All of the following are **❌ banned**:

- ❌ The use of **macros**.
- ❌ Players **taking turns** during a run.
- ❌ The use of **aiming sights**/**reticule mods**.
- ❌ **Host transfer** (host leaving during a run).
- ❌ Going **overtime**, except for a Blitz: Search and Destroy/Destroy Illuminate Warp Ships mission in the context of an **Operation 100% solo** or an **All Factions 100% solo** run.
- ❌ The use of **DSS** (Democracy Space Station) and **Free Stratagems**.

However:

- ✔️ You may submit a run when a **Free Stratagem** is available as long as **no runner uses it**. All POVs must be submitted.
- ✔️ You may submit a run done on a planet where the **DSS** is **inactive**. If the **DSS** is **active**, none of its **benefits** shall be used:

### 1.2. COMMUNITY GUIDELINES

- ❌ Do not **save up runs** to post them all at once for **dramatic effect**. Hitting a lot of runs in a single speedrun session and posting them is **allowed** but **hoarding** runs is not.
- ❌ **Verifiers** and **moderators** may **not self-verify** runs.

__________

## 2. SUBMISSION GUIDELINE

### 2.1. DUAL SUBMISSIONS SCOPE

- ✔️ You may **submit** segments of **full game runs** by **trimming** the recording and submit them as a **separate videos**.
- ⚠️ You may submit missions without **optional objectives** and **outposts** **ONLY** to the **100%** and **Any%** categories, not to **Extract%**.

The board is organized around the **minimum** and **maximum difficulty** of each mission, compiled in a [list](https://www.speedrun.com/Helldivers2/guides/y5pu3). The **Legacy** category includes the **former maximum difficulties** as well as the ***Any Other Difficulty*** subcategory. The latter ensures runs submitted with another difficulty level are **not orphaned**.

### 2.2. DUAL SUBMISSIONS TABLES

✔️ You may dual **dual submit** runs in [main page](https://www.speedrun.com/Helldivers2) and [Category Extensions](https://www.speedrun.com/HELLDIVERS_2_Category_Extensions) categories if **all** the **requirements** are met in the categories you wish to submit to (Completion, No Major Glitches, Deathless, Un-Scouted).

***No Major Glitches*** is abbreviated ***NMG*** in the tables below.

## 3. STANDARDS OF PROOF

### 3.1. RECORDING REQUIREMENTS

- All submissions require **video evidence**.
- Runs must be done and recorded in **one segment**. For longer runs, console players may **stream** and link the VOD.
- The **time** you submit must be the one shown by the **In-Game Timer** in the **score screen**.

⚠️ If your recording has **video**/**audio issues** (freezing, gaps, stutters, lag), please contact a moderator. The run may be verified if the issues **do not interfere** with **essential elements** (game version, Un-Scouted proof, gameplay, etc.). If the issues are **severe** and more proof is required (free stratagem, Un-Scouted proof, host for Hive Lord%, etc.), at least **one other POV** is required for a multiplayer run. It must help **identify** what is happening on the broken POV. In the case of a **solo run** with severe recording issues, the run will be **rejected** due to an inability to obtain proof from other POVs.

Your recording **must include**:

- The screen showing **stratagems** and **boosters** as well as the **loading screen**.
- The **score screen**.
- **In-game audio** (**Master Volume** and **Sound Effects Volume**. Other audio settings can be muted).
- The **game version** (visible in the **pause screen**/**social window**):

### 3.2. HUD VISIBILITY

The **visibility** of the following **HUD elements** must be enabled in your settings (**Options** > **HUD**) and **must not be covered** in the recording (*e.g.* by a **camera overlay**).

⚠️ **First time submitters** will be given a single instance of **leniency** only regarding **HUD visibility** and **audio requirements** rules. Runners will receive a **warning** and all future submissions not complying with these rules will be **rejected**.

### 3.3. UN-SCOUTED PROOF

To **scout** means to drop into a mission then **quitting the game** in order to keep the **map seed** and replay it. To do an *Un-Scouted* run means to play it **blindly**.

⚠️ While it is a **descriptive annotation** for most of the level runs, **Un-Scouted** is a **mandatory requirement** for submitting to **all full game categories** (in both [main page](https://www.speedrun.com/Helldivers2) and [Category Extensions](https://www.speedrun.com/HELLDIVERS_2_Category_Extensions)), except the following:

- **Operation Any%** (Scouted Seed).
- **Hive Lord%**.
- **Tutorial Any%**.
- **Tutorial No OoB**.
- **Stratagem Hero**.

⚠️ It is also a **mandatory requirement** if you wish to submit a **level run** to the **100% Un-Scouted** category (to be found in [Category Extensions](https://www.speedrun.com/HELLDIVERS_2_Category_Extensions)).

⚠️ To submit a **mission** from an **Un-Scouted operation**, your submission must include a link to the recording of the **entire operation**. This way, the second or third mission of an operation can be verified as **Un-Scouted**.

Your submission **must** portray one of the **following scenarios** at the start of the recording. Otherwise, it will be either labeled as **Scouted** or **rejected**. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHufX1U3qzo) shows a **concrete example** for each scenario.

‼️ **PLEASE READ CAREFULLY**: since patch **1.004.100**, operations duplicate on all planets, depending on the faction. Therefore, the **ONLY VALID UN-SCOUTED PROOFS SINCE PATCH 1.004.100 ARE**:

- Abandon mission.
- Completing another operation.

The following proofs are **invalid since patch 1.004.100** but **remain valid on previous patches**:

- Back and forth.
- Abandon operation.
- Green/red checkmark.

The only exception is **Oshaune**, as it spawns unique operations and is therefore **not subject to duplication**. You may use any proof to submit an Un-Scouted run on this planet.
